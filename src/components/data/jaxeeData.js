(&ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jaxee&rdquo;) governing your use of the Jaxee Platform (as defined below), Company&rsquo;s website (Jaxee.com or the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) or mobile applications. The platform services provided by Company, the Site and mobile applications together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Jaxee Platform.&rdquo; Your use of the Jaxee Platform constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy (the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;), and any future amendments and additions to this Agreement (as defined below) as we may publish from time to time.</p>\n\n<h5>1. The Jaxee Platform connects Experts and Customer Members seeking Jobs.</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is a platform which enables Customer Members and Experts to meet. &ldquo;Customer Members&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain services (&ldquo;Jobs&rdquo;) from Experts and are therefore Customer Members of Experts, and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses that specialize in a particular field of service that are seeking to perform Jobs for Customer Members. EXPERTS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS OR IN ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM JOBS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM JOBS FOR CUSTOMER MEMBERS. EXPERT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR AN EXPERT&rsquo;S WORK AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK PERFORMED OR THE JOBS IN ANY MANNER. EXPERTS ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ALL WORK PERFORMED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE COMPANY&rsquo;S WEBSITE OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS. The Jaxee Platform only enables referrals between Customer Members and Experts for the fulfillment of Jobs. Company is not responsible for the performance of the Customer Members, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other element whatsoever of Jobs, Experts, Customer Members, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Customer Members or Expert. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, fitness or, warranty or accuracy of the Jobs requested and Jobs provided by Experts referred through the Jaxee Platform whether in public, private, or offline interactions.</p>\n\n<h5>2. Screening of Experts and Representation and Warranties of Experts</h5>\n\n<p>In Company&rsquo;s sole discretion, Experts may be subject to an extensive screening process before they can register for and during their use of the Jaxee Platform, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and local level, and license and/or permit checks if applicable. Experts hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although Company may perform background checks of Experts, as outlined above, Company is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each Expert is who they claim to be and therefore, Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the Jaxee Platform. By registering or using the Platform to offer, post or provide Jobs, Expert Members represent and warrant that they, and the employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors who may perform work for them, are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed, certified, bonded, and insured, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they offer their Job and in relation to the specific Job they are performing. Jaxee is not in the business of providing Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the ability to use the Jaxee Platform to access persons interested in receiving Jobs and related tools, including but not limited to the ability to message Customer Members or schedule appointments, that facilitate the provision of Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that any Jaxee users will engage them for Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that they are customers of Jaxee, and are not Jaxee employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Expert acknowledges that it sets or confirms its own prices, provides its own equipment, and determines its own work schedule. Jaxee does not control, and has no right to control, the services an Expert provides (including how the Expert provides such services) if the Expert is engaged by a Customer Member, except as specifically noted herein. Company does not screen its Customer Members. When interacting with Customer Members or other Experts, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don&rsquo;t know.

You agree that Company is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Expert.

Company will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs or other services. Payment for Jobs through the Jaxee Platform is made directly from the Customer Member to the Expert and not by Company.

Payment processing services for Expert on the Jaxee Platform are provided by Stripe, Paypal and any other payment services provider utilized by Jaxee from time to time in connection with the Jaxee Platform (each a &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;, and collectively, the &ldquo;PSPs&rdquo; ) and are subject to the PSPs&rsquo; agreements and terms of service governing their respective payment services (collectively, the &ldquo;PSP Services Agreement&rdquo;). By agreeing to this Agreement or continuing to operate as a an Expert on the Jaxee Platform, you agree to be bound by the PSP Services Agreement, as the same may be amended or modified by the PSPs from time to time. As a condition of the Jaxee Platform enabling payment processing services through the PSPs, you agree to provide the Jaxee Platform accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Jaxee to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by the PSPs. Customer Members using the Jaxee Platform will be required to provide their credit card and/or PayPal account information to Company and the PSPs retained by Company (the &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;), to the extent any you have elected to accept payment for Jobs via the Jaxee Platform by and through the PSPs. Experts are responsible for invoicing their Customer Members within 24 hours of the work being performed even if the Job is not completed in its entirety or is designed as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.

Experts will be responsible for paying to Company: (i) Jaxee Platform marketing/booking fees, (ii) repayment of erroneous payments made by the PSP, (iii) any and all fees PayPal may charge the Expert or the Company for processing a payment via PayPal and (iv) a handling fee of six percent (6%) of the aggregate amount of any Invoice paid by a Customer Member via credit card.

Experts are responsible for calculating and invoicing for any applicable taxes due from the Customer Member for the Job performed.</p>\n\n<h5>5. Release; Limitation of Liability</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is only a venue for connecting Customer Members and Experts.

(&ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jaxee&rdquo;) governing your use of the Jaxee Platform (as defined below), Company&rsquo;s website (Jaxee.com or the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) or mobile applications. The platform services provided by Company, the Site and mobile applications together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Jaxee Platform.&rdquo; Your use of the Jaxee Platform constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy (the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;), and any future amendments and additions to this Agreement (as defined below) as we may publish from time to time.</p>\n\n<h5>1. The Jaxee Platform connects Experts and Customer Members seeking Jobs.</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is a platform which enables Customer Members and Experts to meet. &ldquo;Customer Members&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain services (&ldquo;Jobs&rdquo;) from Experts and are therefore Customer Members of Experts, and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses that specialize in a particular field of service that are seeking to perform Jobs for Customer Members. EXPERTS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS OR IN ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM JOBS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM JOBS FOR CUSTOMER MEMBERS. EXPERT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR AN EXPERT&rsquo;S WORK AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK PERFORMED OR THE JOBS IN ANY MANNER. EXPERTS ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ALL WORK PERFORMED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE COMPANY&rsquo;S WEBSITE OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS. The Jaxee Platform only enables referrals between Customer Members and Experts for the fulfillment of Jobs. Company is not responsible for the performance of the Customer Members, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other element whatsoever of Jobs, Experts, Customer Members, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Customer Members or Expert. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, fitness or, warranty or accuracy of the Jobs requested and Jobs provided by Experts referred through the Jaxee Platform whether in public, private, or offline interactions.</p>\n\n<h5>2. Screening of Experts and Representation and Warranties of Experts</h5>\n\n<p>In Company&rsquo;s sole discretion, Experts may be subject to an extensive screening process before they can register for and during their use of the Jaxee Platform, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and local level, and license and/or permit checks if applicable. Experts hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although Company may perform background checks of Experts, as outlined above, Company is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each Expert is who they claim to be and therefore, Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the Jaxee Platform. By registering or using the Platform to offer, post or provide Jobs, Expert Members represent and warrant that they, and the employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors who may perform work for them, are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed, certified, bonded, and insured, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they offer their Job and in relation to the specific Job they are performing. Jaxee is not in the business of providing Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the ability to use the Jaxee Platform to access persons interested in receiving Jobs and related tools, including but not limited to the ability to message Customer Members or schedule appointments, that facilitate the provision of Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that any Jaxee users will engage them for Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that they are customers of Jaxee, and are not Jaxee employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Expert acknowledges that it sets or confirms its own prices, provides its own equipment, and determines its own work schedule. Jaxee does not control, and has no right to control, the services an Expert provides (including how the Expert provides such services) if the Expert is engaged by a Customer Member, except as specifically noted herein. Company does not screen its Customer Members. When interacting with Customer Members or other Experts, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don&rsquo;t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY CUSTOMER MEMBER CUSTOMER MEMBER OR EXPERT USER OF THE JAXEE PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.

You hereby warrant and represent that you will respect the privacy, property and data protection rights of Customer Members and other Experts and that you will not record (whether video or audio or otherwise) any Job or any interaction by or with any Customer Member User and/or Expert in connection with the Jaxee Platform without the prior written consent of such party. You further represent and warrant that you will fulfill the commitments you make to Customer Members including receiving payment through the Jaxee Platform (where you have elected to accept payment via credit card) or otherwise (where you have elected to accept payment via cash or check), communicating clearly and promptly with the Customer Member and/or respond to inquiries promptly, being present and/or available at the time you agree upon with the Customer Member and utilizing the third party payment processing system specified or approved by us to make or receive payment for Jobs provided through the Jaxee Platform.

The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed by you and accepted by the Customer Member on the Jaxee Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Expert and the Customer Member to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement including this Section and do not expand Company&rsquo;s obligations or restrict Company&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Expert. Customer Member Expert</p>\n\n<h5>4. Billing and Payment</h5>\n\n<p>Users of the Jaxee Platform contract for Jobs directly with Customer Members. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs or other services. Payment for Jobs through the Jaxee Platform is made directly from the Customer Member to the Expert and not by Company. Company is not obligated to pay the Expert for a Customer Member&rsquo;s failure to pay for Jobs. Payment processing services for Expert on the Jaxee Platform are provided by Stripe, Paypal and any other payment services provider utilized by Jaxee from time to time in connection with the Jaxee Platform (each a &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;, and collectively, the &ldquo;PSPs&rdquo; ) and are subject to the PSPs&rsquo; agreements and terms of service governing their respective payment services (collectively, the &ldquo;PSP Services Agreement&rdquo;). By agreeing to this Agreement or continuing to operate as a an Expert on the Jaxee Platform, you agree to be bound by the PSP Services Agreement, as the same may be amended or modified by the PSPs from time to time. As a condition of the Jaxee Platform enabling payment processing services through the PSPs, you agree to provide the Jaxee Platform accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Jaxee to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by the PSPs. Customer Members using the Jaxee Platform will be required to provide their credit card and/or PayPal account information to Company and the PSPs retained by Company (the &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;), to the extent any you have elected to accept payment for Jobs via the Jaxee Platform by and through the PSPs. Experts are responsible for invoicing their Customer Members within 24 hours of the work being performed even if the Job is not completed in its entirety or is designed as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. Customer Members will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Job (the &ldquo;Invoice&rdquo;), which will include: (i) the pricing terms of the Job agreed upon, (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by an Expert in connection with the Jobs provided; and (iii) any tip or gratuity, if applicable. Experts will be responsible for paying to Company: (i) Jaxee Platform marketing/booking fees, (ii) repayment of erroneous payments made by the PSP, (iii) any and all fees PayPal may charge the Expert or the Company for processing a payment via PayPal and (iv) a handling fee of six percent (6%) of the aggregate amount of any Invoice paid by a Customer Member via credit card. Jaxee reserves the right, in its sole discretion, upon request from the Customer Member or the Expert upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the Jaxee Platform, to (i) place on hold any payment relating to or arising out of an Invoice, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so. Experts are responsible for calculating and invoicing for any applicable taxes due from the Customer Member for the Job performed.</p>\n\n<h5>5. Release; Limitation of Liability</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is only a venue for connecting Customer Members and Experts. Because Company is not involved in the actual contact between Customer Members or in the completion of the Job, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Customer Members, you, the Expert, release Company and its affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

Fees for additional products or services, including ongoing products or services, will be provided to you before you use such products or services. You agree to pay these Fees. You agree to pay all applicable Fees or charges based on the Fee and billing terms then in effect, regardless of whether you have an active Account. You hereby authorize Jaxee to charge your credit card, PayPal or other payment method designated at the time you make a purchase or register for a service. If you do not pay on time or if Jaxee cannot charge a credit card, PayPal or other payment method for any reason, Jaxee reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment and all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, in our pursuit of payment. You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or Fees due will be made by electronic mail or by phone. Such communication may be made by Jaxee or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent. If you cancel your Account at any time, you will not receive any refund. If you have a balance due on any Account, you agree that Jaxee may charge such unpaid Fees to your credit card or otherwise bill you for such unpaid Fees. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting and sales tax collection requirements in consultation with tax advisers, and that we cannot and do not offer specific tax advice to either Expert Members or Customer Members. All sales on Jaxee are final and non-refundable, except as otherwise specified herein.</p>\n\n<p>PAYMENTS</p>\n\n<p>Customer Members shall pay their Expert for completed Jobs either directly or through the payment processing feature provided by Jaxee via the Platform at the rates agreed to by the Customer Member and the Expert Member. If any Member does not make a marketplace payment on time or if Jaxee cannot charge a credit card, PayPal or other payment method for any reason as directed by an Expert Member or the Customer Member, Jaxee and/or the Expert Member reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment and all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, in pursuit of such payment. You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or payments due will be made by electronic mail or by phone. Such communication may be made by Jaxee and/or the Expert Member or by anyone on their behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent. If you have a balance due on any Account, you agree that Jaxee and/or the Expert Member may charge such unpaid payments to your credit card or otherwise bill you for such unpaid payments. To help prevent fraud and safeguard Customer Member information from the risk of unauthorized access, Company and/or its third party payment processor may validate an account before activation by placing a temporary charge on the account associated with the Customer Member and then refund the charged amount within 1-3 business days. Due to the difference in third party payment processor and credit card issuer requirements, this temporary charge may vary between $0.01 US to $5000.00 US depending on the estimated value of the Job and reimbursements. When a Customer Member receives confirmation through the Platform or via email that a Job has been completed, the Customer Member hereby authorizes Jaxee to provide Customer Member&rsquo;s payment details to the third party payment processor for processing of the Fee for the Job, out of pocket expenses owed to the Expert, and the service charge and fees owed to Jaxee for the use of the Platform. Members may be charged a cancellation fee through the third party payment processor if you book a Job, but cancel it before it is completed, as set forth in the Jaxee pricing terms or if you agree to perform a Job but fail to complete it, as may be set forth in the Jaxee pricing terms. All cancellation and refund requests will be subject to Jaxee&rsquo;s review and absolute discretion. We will normally process your valid written request within thirty (30) days of receiving it, unless a shorter period is required by law. You may request a cancellation or refund by emailing your request to Jaxee support at support@Jaxee.com. If you cancel your Account at any time, you will not receive any refund.</p>\n\n<p>JAXEE CREDITS</p>\n\n<p>Your purchase or receipt of Jaxee Credits represents the purchase or receipt of credits that can be used by you to receive certain services on the Platform, including accepting Job requests from potential customers. We will always be transparent with you about the number or range of Jaxee Credits you must use to access certain services. Jaxee Credits have no monetary/cash value and your purchase or receipt of Jaxee Credits does not represent a pre-funding of stored value that can be accessed or used in the future for any purpose. However, if you have a balance of paid-for Jaxee Credits and Jaxee elects to end the Credit program or you terminate your participation in the Jaxee Services, you can request a refund of any paid-for Credits remaining in your account. You agree that all sales of Jaxee Credits are final. Information and current pricing can be found in the Help Center.</p>\n\n<p>DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG USERS</p>\n\n<p>Jaxee values our Customer Members and Expert Members, and we understand that occasionally disputes may arise between or among them.

(&ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jaxee&rdquo;) governing your use of the Jaxee Platform (as defined below), Company&rsquo;s website (Jaxee.com or the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) or mobile applications. The platform services provided by Company, the Site and mobile applications together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Jaxee Platform.&rdquo; Your use of the Jaxee Platform constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy (the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;), and any future amendments and additions to this Agreement (as defined below) as we may publish from time to time.</p>\n\n<h5>1. The Jaxee Platform connects Experts and Customer Members seeking Jobs.</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is a platform which enables Customer Members and Experts to meet. &ldquo;Customer Members&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain services (&ldquo;Jobs&rdquo;) from Experts and are therefore Customer Members of Experts, and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo; are individuals and/or businesses that specialize in a particular field of service that are seeking to perform Jobs for Customer Members. EXPERTS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS OR IN ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM JOBS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM JOBS FOR CUSTOMER MEMBERS. EXPERT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR AN EXPERT&rsquo;S WORK AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK PERFORMED OR THE JOBS IN ANY MANNER. EXPERTS ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ALL WORK PERFORMED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE COMPANY&rsquo;S WEBSITE OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS. The Jaxee Platform only enables referrals between Customer Members and Experts for the fulfillment of Jobs. Company is not responsible for the performance of the Customer Members, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other element whatsoever of Jobs, Experts, Customer Members, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Customer Members or Expert. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, fitness or, warranty or accuracy of the Jobs requested and Jobs provided by Experts referred through the Jaxee Platform whether in public, private, or offline interactions.</p>\n\n<h5>2. Screening of Experts and Representation and Warranties of Experts</h5>\n\n<p>In Company&rsquo;s sole discretion, Experts may be subject to an extensive screening process before they can register for and during their use of the Jaxee Platform, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and local level, and license and/or permit checks if applicable. Experts hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although Company may perform background checks of Experts, as outlined above, Company is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each Expert is who they claim to be and therefore, Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the Jaxee Platform. By registering or using the Platform to offer, post or provide Jobs, Expert Members represent and warrant that they, and the employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors who may perform work for them, are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed, certified, bonded, and insured, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they offer their Job and in relation to the specific Job they are performing. Jaxee is not in the business of providing Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the ability to use the Jaxee Platform to access persons interested in receiving Jobs and related tools, including but not limited to the ability to message Customer Members or schedule appointments, that facilitate the provision of Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that any Jaxee users will engage them for Jobs. Expert Members understand and agree that they are customers of Jaxee, and are not Jaxee employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Expert acknowledges that it sets or confirms its own prices, provides its own equipment, and determines its own work schedule. Jaxee does not control, and has no right to control, the services an Expert provides (including how the Expert provides such services) if the Expert is engaged by a Customer Member, except as specifically noted herein. Company does not screen its Customer Members. When interacting with Customer Members or other Experts, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don&rsquo;t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY CUSTOMER MEMBER CUSTOMER MEMBER OR EXPERT USER OF THE JAXEE PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.

The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed by you and accepted by the Customer Member on the Jaxee Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Expert and the Customer Member to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement including this Section and do not expand Company&rsquo;s obligations or restrict Company&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Expert.

Company will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs or other services. Payment for Jobs through the Jaxee Platform is made directly from the Customer Member to the Expert and not by Company. Company is not obligated to pay the Expert for a Customer Member&rsquo;s failure to pay for Jobs. Payment processing services for Expert on the Jaxee Platform are provided by Stripe, Paypal and any other payment services provider utilized by Jaxee from time to time in connection with the Jaxee Platform (each a &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;, and collectively, the &ldquo;PSPs&rdquo; ) and are subject to the PSPs&rsquo; agreements and terms of service governing their respective payment services (collectively, the &ldquo;PSP Services Agreement&rdquo;). By agreeing to this Agreement or continuing to operate as a an Expert on the Jaxee Platform, you agree to be bound by the PSP Services Agreement, as the same may be amended or modified by the PSPs from time to time. As a condition of the Jaxee Platform enabling payment processing services through the PSPs, you agree to provide the Jaxee Platform accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Jaxee to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by the PSPs. Customer Members using the Jaxee Platform will be required to provide their credit card and/or PayPal account information to Company and the PSPs retained by Company (the &ldquo;PSP&rdquo;), to the extent any you have elected to accept payment for Jobs via the Jaxee Platform by and through the PSPs. Experts are responsible for invoicing their Customer Members within 24 hours of the work being performed even if the Job is not completed in its entirety or is designed as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. Customer Members will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Job (the &ldquo;Invoice&rdquo;), which will include: (i) the pricing terms of the Job agreed upon, (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by an Expert in connection with the Jobs provided; and (iii) any tip or gratuity, if applicable. Experts will be responsible for paying to Company: (i) Jaxee Platform marketing/booking fees, (ii) repayment of erroneous payments made by the PSP, (iii) any and all fees PayPal may charge the Expert or the Company for processing a payment via PayPal and (iv) a handling fee of six percent (6%) of the aggregate amount of any Invoice paid by a Customer Member via credit card.

Experts are responsible for calculating and invoicing for any applicable taxes due from the Customer Member for the Job performed.</p>\n\n<h5>5. Release; Limitation of Liability</h5>\n\n<p>The Jaxee Platform is only a venue for connecting Customer Members and Experts. Because Company is not involved in the actual contact between Customer Members or in the completion of the Job, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Customer Members, you, the Expert, release Company and its affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
